This project is a fork of mikpetr's [performance test](https://github.com/mikpetr/react-performance-test) which was retrofitted to bootstrap with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is currently deployed [here](https://sridatta19.github.io/react-performance-test/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
